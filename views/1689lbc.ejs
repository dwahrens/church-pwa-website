          Judicious and Impartial Reader</h4>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          Courteous Reader,
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          It is now many years since divers of us (with other sober Christians then living and walking in the way of the
          Lord
          that we professe) did conceive our selves to be under a necessity of Publishing a Confession of our Faith, for
          the
          information, and satisfaction of those, that did not throughly understand what our principles were, or had
          entertained prejudices against our Profession, by reason of the strange representation of them, by some men of
          note,
          who had taken very wrong measures, and accordingly led others into misapprehensions, of us, and them: and this
          was
          first put forth about the year, 1643. in the name of seven Congregations then gathered in London; since which
          time,
          diverse impressions thereof have been dispersed abroad, and our end proposed, in good measure answered,
          inasmuch as
          many (and some of those men eminent, both for piety and learning) were thereby satisfied, that we were no way
          guilty
          of those Heterodoxies and fundamental errors, which had too frequently been charged upon us without ground, or
          occasion given on our part. And forasmuch, as that Confession is not now commonly to be had; and also that
          many
          others have since embraced the same truth which is owned therein; it was judged necessary by us to joyn
          together in
          giving a testimony to the world; of our firm adhering to those wholesome Principles, by the publication of
          this
          which is now in your hand.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          And forasmuch as our method, and manner of expressing our sentiments, in this, doth vary from the former
          (although
          the substance of the matter is the same) we shall freely impart to you the reason and occasion thereof. One
          thing
          that greatly prevailed with us to undertake this work, was (not only to give a full account of our selves, to
          those
          Christians that differ from us about the subject of Baptism, but also) the profit that might from thence
          arise, unto
          those that have any account of our labors, in their instruction, and establishment in the great truths of the
          Gospel; in the clear understanding, and steady belief of which, our comfortable walking with God, and
          fruitfulness
          before him, in all our ways, is most neerly concerned; and therefore we did conclude it necessary to expresse
          our
          selves the more fully, and distinctly; and also to fix on such a method as might be most comprehensive of
          those
          things which we designed to explain our sense, and belief of; and finding no defect, in this regard, in that
          fixed
          on by the assembly, and after them by those of the Congregational way, we did readily conclude it best to
          retain the
          same order in our present confession: and also, when we observed that those last mentioned, did in their
          confession
          (for reasons which seemed of weight both to themselves and others) choose not only to express their mind in
          words
          concurrent with the former in sense, concerning all those articles wherein they were agreed, but also for the
          most
          part without any variation of the terms we did in like manner conclude it best to follow their example in
          making use
          of the very same words with them both, in these articles (which are very many) wherein our faith and doctrine
          is the
          same with theirs, and this we did, the more abundantly, to manifest our consent with both, in all the
          fundamental
          articles of the Christian Religion, as also with many others, whose orthodox confessions have been published
          to the
          world; on behalf of the Protestants in divers Nations and Cities: and also to convince all, that we have no
          itch to
          clogge Religion with new words, but do readily acquiesce in that form of sound words, which hath been, in
          consent
          with the holy Scriptures, used by others before us; hereby declaring before God, Angels, & Men, our hearty
          agreement
          with them, in that wholesome Protestant Doctrine, which with so clear evidence of Scriptures they have
          asserted:
          some things indeed, are in some places added, some terms omitted, and some few changed, but these alterations
          are of
          that nature, as that we need not doubt, any charge or suspition of unsoundness in the faith, from any of our
          brethren upon the account of them.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          In those things wherein we differ from others, we have exprest our selves with all candor and plainness that
          none
          might entertain jealousie of ought secretly lodged in our breasts, that we would not the world should be
          acquainted
          with; yet we hope we have also observed those rules of modesty, and humility, as will render our freedom in
          this
          respect inoffensive, even to those whose sentiments are different from ours.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          We have also taken care to affix texts of Scripture, in the margin for the confirmation of each article in our
          confession; in which work we have studiously indeavoured to select such as are most clear and pertinent, for
          the
          proof of what is asserted by us: and our earnest desire is, that all into whose hands this may come, would
          follow
          that (never enough commended) example of the noble Bereans, who searched the Scriptures daily, that they might
          find
          out whether the things preached to them were so or not.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          There is one thing more which we sincerely professe, and earnestly desire credence in, viz. That contention is
          most
          remote from our design in all that we have done in this matter: and we hope the liberty of an ingenuous
          unfolding
          our principles, and opening our hearts unto our Brethren, with the Scripture grounds on which our faith and
          practise
          leanes, will by none of them be either denyed to us, or taken ill from us. Our whole design is accomplished,
          if we
          may obtain that Justice, as to be measured in our principles, and practise, and the judgement of both by
          others,
          according to what we have now published; which the Lord (whose eyes are as a flame of fire) knoweth to be the
          doctrine, which with our hearts we must firmly believe, and sincerely indeavour to conform our lives to. And
          oh that
          other contentions being laid asleep, the only care and contention of all upon whom the name of our blessed
          Redeemer
          is called, might for the future be, to walk humbly with their God, and in the exercise of all Love and
          Meekness
          towards each other, to perfect holyness in the fear of the Lord, each one endeavouring to have his
          conversation such
          as becometh the Gospel; and also suitable to his place and capacity vigorously to promote in others the
          practice of
          true Religion and undefiled in the sight of God and our Father. And that in this backsliding day, we might not
          spend
          our breath in fruitless complaints of the evils of others; but may every one begin at home, to reform in the
          first
          place our own hearts, and wayes; and then to quicken all that we may have influence upon, to the same work;
          that if
          the will of God were so, none might deceive themselves, by resting in, and trusting to, a form of Godliness,
          without
          the power of it, and inward experience of the efficacy of those truths that are professed by them.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          And verily there is one spring and cause of the decay of Religion in our day, which we cannot but touch upon,
          and
          earnestly urge a redresse of; and that is the neglect of the worship of God in Families, by those to whom the
          charge
          and conduct of them is committed. May not the grosse ignorance, and instability of many; with the prophaneness
          of
          others, be justly charged upon their Parents and Masters; who have not trained them up in the way wherein they
          ought
          to walk when they were young? but have neglected those frequent and solemn commands which the Lord hath laid
          upon
          them so to catechize, and instruct them, that their tender years might be seasoned with the knowledge of the
          truth
          of God as revealed in the Scriptures; and also by their own omission of Prayer, and other duties of Religion
          in
          their families, together with the ill example of their loose conversation, have inured them first to a
          neglect, and
          then contempt of all Piety and Religion? we know this will not excuse the blindness, or wickedness of any; but
          certainly it will fall heavy upon those that have thus been the occasion thereof; they indeed dye in their
          sins; but
          will not their blood be required of those under whose care they were, who yet permitted them to go on without
          warning, yea led them into the paths of destruction? and will not the diligence of Christians with respect to
          the
          discharge of these duties, in ages past, rise up in judgment against, and condemn many of those who would be
          esteemed such now?
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          We shall conclude with our earnest prayer, that the God of all grace, will pour out those measures of his holy
          Spirit upon us, that the profession of truth may be accompanyed with the sound belief, and diligent practise
          of it
          by us; that his name may in all things be glorified, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

          forasmuch as it
          may justly be
          expected that we
          shew some reason,
          why we cannot
          acquiesce in what
          hath been urged
          against us; we
          shall with as much
          brevity as may
          consist with

          endeavour to

          1. As to those
          Christians who
          consent with us,
          That Repentance
          from dead works,
          and Faith towards
          God, and our Lord
          Jesus Christ, is
          required in
          persons to be
          Baptized; and do
          therefore supply
          the defect of the
          (infant being
          uncapable of
          making confession
          of either) by
          others who do
          undertake these
          things for it.
          Although we do
          find by
          Church history
          that this hath
          been a very
          antient practise;
          yet considering,
          that the same
          Scripture which
          does
          caution us against
          censuring our
          brother, with whom
          we shall all stand
          before the
          judgment seat of
          Christ, does also
          instruct us, That
          every one of us
          shall give an
          accompt of himself
          to God, and
          whatsoever is not
          of Faith is Sin.
          Rom. 14:4, 10, 12,
          23. Therefore we
          cannot for our own
          parts be perswaded
          in our own minds,
          to build such a
          practise
          as this, upon an
          unwritten
          tradition: But do
          rather choose in
          all points of
          Faith and Worship,
          to have recourse
          to
          the holy
          Scriptures, for
          the information of
          our judgment, and
          regulation of our
          practise; being
          well assured that
          a
          conscientious
          attending thereto,
          is the best way to
          prevent, and
          rectifie our
          defects and
          errors. 2 Tim. 3.
          16,17.
          And if any such
          case happen to be
          debated between
          Christians, which
          is not plainly
          determinable by
          the Scriptures,
          we think it safest
          to leave such
          things undecided
          until the second
          coming of our Lord
          Jesus; as they did
          in the
          Church of old,
          until there should
          arise a Priest
          with Urim and
          Thummim, that
          might certainly
          inform them of the
          mind
          of God thereabout,

          our Christian
          brethren who do
          ground their
          arguments for
          Infants baptism,
          upon a presumed
          faederal
          Holiness, or
          Church-Membership,
          we conceive they
          are deficient in
          this, that albeit
          this
          Covenant-Holiness
          and
          Membership should
          be as is supposed,
          in reference unto
          the Infants of
          Believers; yet no
          command for Infant
          baptism
          does immediately
          and directly
          result from such a
          quality, or

          So it was in the
          Covenant that God
          made with Abraham
          and his Seed. The
          sign whereof was
          appropriated only
          to the
          Male,
          notwithstanding
          that the female
          seed as well as

          comprehended in
          the Covenant and
          part of the
          Church of God;
          neither was this
          sign to be affixed
          to any Male Infant
          till he was eight
          dayes old, albeit

          his life; nor

          of death, or any
          other supposed
          necessity, warrant
          the circumcising
          of him before the
          set time, nor was
          there any cause
          for it; the
          commination of
          being cut off from
          his people, being
          only upon the
          neglect, or

          This may suffice
          to shew, that

          off-spring from
          all the rest of
          the world, as a
          people
          holy unto the
          Lord, and did
          constitute them
          the visible Church
          of God, (though
          not comprehensive
          of all the
          faithful
          in the world) yet
          the sign of this
          Covenant was not
          affixed to all the
          persons that were
          within this
          Covenant, nor

          servants of God,

          descent from
          Abraham. And
          consequently that
          it depends purely
          upon the will of
          the Law-giver, to
          determine what
          shall be the sign
          of his Covenant,
          unto whom, at what

          If our brethren do
          suppose baptism to
          be the seal of the
          Covenant which God
          makes with every
          beleiver (of which
          the
          Scriptures are
          altogether silent)
          it is not our
          concern to contend
          with them herein;
          yet we conceive
          the seal of
          that Covenant is
          the indwelling of
          the Spirit of
          Christ in the
          particular and
          individual persons
          in whom he
          resides,
          and nothing else,
          neither do they or
          we suppose that
          baptism is in any
          such manner
          substituted in the
          place of
          circumcision, as
          to have the same
          (and no other)
          latitude, extent,
          or terms, then
          circumcision had;
          for that was
          suited only for
          the Male children,
          baptism is an
          ordinance suited
          for every
          beleiver, whether
          male, or femal.
          That
          extended to all
          the males that
          were born in
          Abrahams house, or
          bought with his
          money, equally
          with the males
          that
          proceeded from his
          own loynes; but
          baptisme is not so
          far extended in
          any true Christian
          Church that we
          know of, as
          to be administred
          to all the poor
          infidel servants,
          that the members
          thereof purchase
          for their service,
          and
          introduce into
          their families;
          nor to the
          children born of
          them in their
          house.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          But we conceive
          the same parity of
          reasoning may hold
          for the ordinance
          of baptism as for
          that of
          circumcision;
          Exodus 12.49. viz.
          one law for the
          stranger, as for
          the home born: If
          any desire to be
          admitted to all
          the
          ordinances, and
          priviledges of
          Gods house, the
          door is open; upon
          the same terms
          that any one
          person was ever
          admitted to all,
          or any of those
          priviledges, that
          belong to the
          Christian Church;
          may all persons of
          right
          challenge the like
          admission.

        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          As for that text
          of Scripture, Rom.
          4. 11. He received
          circumcision a
          seal of the
          righteousness of
          the faith which
          he had yet being
          uncircumcised; we
          conceive if the
          Apostles scope in
          that place be duly
          attended to, it
          will appear
          that no argument
          can be taken from
          thence to inforce
          Infant baptism;
          and forasmuch as
          we find a full and
          fair
          account of those

          partiality in this

          end of it being
          especially
          fulfilled; for
          which it had been
          instituted: this
          end the Apostle
          declares in these
          words, Rom. 4.11

          I fear that by
          most translations

          Other versions are

          given to Abraham
          for a Seal of that
          Righteousness
          which he had being
          yet uncircumcised,
          which we will not
          deny to be in some
          sense true, but we
          believe that
          circumcision had
          chiefly a far
          different respect.

          seal of the
          Righteousness of
          Faith, which was
          to be in the
          uncircumcision,
          Which was to be (I
          say) not which had
          been, not that
          which Abraham had
          whilst he was yet
          uncircumcised; but
          that which his
          uncircumcised seed
          should have, that
          is the Gentiles,
          who in

          wherefore was
          circumcision
          instituted to him?
          For the sealing
          of the same
          promise. Thou
          shalt be the
          Father of many
          Nations. So that
          this is the sense
          of the Apostle;
          most
          agreeable to the
          institution of
          circumcision; he
          received the sign
          of circumcision, a
          seal of the
          Righteousness of
          Faith which in
          time to come the
          uncircumcision (or
          the Gentiles)
          should have and
          obtain.

          Abraham had a
          twofold seed,
          natural, of the
          Jews; and
          faithful, of the
          believing
          Gentiles: his
          natural seed was
          signed with the
          sign of
          circumcision,
          first indeed for
          the distinguishing
          of them from all
          other Nations
          whilst they
          as yet were not
          the seed of
          Abraham, but
          especially for the
          memorial of the
          justification of
          the Gentiles by
          faith,
          when at length
          they should become
          his seed.
          Therefore
          circumcision was
          of right to cease,
          when the Gentiles
          were
          brought in to the
          faith, forasmuch
          as then it had
          obtained its last
          and chief end, &

          not determine
          positively
          concerning the

          the holiness here

          to
          say it is this, or
          that, and no other
          thing; Yet it is
          evident that the
          Apostle does by it
          determine not only
          the
          lawfulness but the
          expedience also of
          a beleivers
          cohabitation with
          an unbeliever, in
          the state of
          marriage.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">
          And we do think
          that although the
          Apostles asserting
          of the unbelieving
          yokefellow to be
          sanctified by the
          believer,
          should carry in it
          somewhat more then
          is in the bare
          marriage of two
          infidels, because
          although the
          marriage
          covenant have a
          divine sanction so
          as to make the
          wedlock of two
          unbelievers a
          lawful action, and
          their conjunction
          and cohabitation
          in that respect
          undefiled, yet
          there might be no
          ground to suppose
          from thence, that
          both or either
          of their persons
          are thereby
          sanctified; and
          the Apostle urges
          the cohabitation
          of a believer with
          an infidel in the
          state of wedlock
          from this ground
          that the
          unbelieving
          husband is
          sanctified by the
          believing wife;
          nevertheless
          here you have the
          influence of a
          believers faith
          ascending from an
          inferior to a
          superior relation;
          from the wife to
          the husband who is
          her head, before
          it can descend to
          their off-spring.
          And therefore we
          say, whatever be
          the nature
          or extent of the
          holiness here
          intended, we
          conceive it cannot
          convey to the
          children an
          immediate right to
          baptism;
          because it would
          then be of another
          nature, and of a
          larger extent,
          then the root, and
          original from
          whence it is
          derived, for it is
          clear by the
          Apostles argument
          that holiness
          cannot be derived
          to the child from
          the sanctity of
          one parent only,
          if either father
          or mother be (in
          the sense intended
          by the Apostle)
          unholy or unclean,
          so will the
          child be also,
          therefore for the
          production of an
          holy seed it is
          necessary that
          both the Parents
          be sanctified; and
          this the Apostle
          positively asserts
          in the first place
          to be done by the
          beleiving parent,
          although the other
          be an
          unbeliever; and
          then
          consequentially
          from thence
          argues, the
          holiness of their
          children. Hence it
          follows, that as
          the children have
          no other holiness
          then what they
          derive from both
          their Parents; so
          neither can they
          have any
          right by this
          holiness to any
          spiritual
          priviledge but
          such as both their
          Parents did also
          partake of: and
          therefore
          if the unbelieving
          Parent (though
          sanctified by the
          believing Parent)
          have not thereby a
          right to baptism,
          neither
          can we concieve,
          that there is any
          such priviledge,
          derived to the
          children by their
          birth-holiness.

          Besides if it had
          been the usual
          practice in the
          Apostles dayes for
          the father or
          mother that did
          beleive, to bring
          all their children
          with them to be
          baptised; then the
          holiness of the
          beleiving
          Corinthians
          children, would
          not at
          all have been in
          question when this
          Epistle was
          written; but might
          have been argued
          from their passing
          under that
          ordinance, which
          represented their
          new birth,
          although they had
          derived no

          their Parents, by
          their
          first birth; and
          would have layen
          as an exception
          against the
          Apostles
          inference, else
          were your Children
          unclean,

          sanctification of
          all the children
          of every beleiver
          by this ordinance,
          or any other way,
          then what
          is

          and three or four

          particular parts
          of Gods law, and
          his worship; the
          Feast of
          Tabernacles (which
          for many centuries
          of years, had not
          been duly
          observed,
          according to the
          institution,
          though it was
          retained in the
          general notion)
          would not have
          been kept in due
          order.

          So may it be now
          as to many things
          relating to the
          service of God,
          which do retain
          the names proper
          to them in their
          first institution,
          but yet through
          inadvertency
          (where there is no
          sinister design)
          may vary in their
          circumstances,
          from their first
          institution. And
          if by means of any
          antient defection,
          or of that general
          corruption of the
          service
          of God, and
          interruption of
          his true worship,
          and persecution of
          his servants by
          the Antichristian
          Bishop of Rome,
          for many
          generations; those
          who do consult the
          Word of God,
          cannot yet arrive
          at a full and
          mutual
          satisfaction
          among themselves,
          what was the
          practise of the
          primitive
          Christian Church,
          in some points
          relating to the
          Worship of
          God: yet inasmuch
          as these things
          are not of the
          essence of
          Christianity, but
          that we agree in
          the fundamental
          doctrines thereof,
          we do apprehend,
          there is
          sufficient ground
          to lay aside all
          bitterness and
          prejudice, and in
          the
          spirit of love and
          meekness to
          imbrace and own
          each other
          therein; leaving
          each other at
          liberty to perform
          such
          other services,
          (wherein we cannot
          concur) apart unto
          God, according to
          the best of our
          understanding.
